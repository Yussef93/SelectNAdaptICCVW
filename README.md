Generalisation of deep neural networks becomes vulnerï¿¾able when distribution shifts are encountered between train
(source) and test (target) domain data. Few-shot domain adaptation mitigates this issue by adapting deep neural netï¿¾works pre-trained on the source domain to the target doï¿¾main using a randomly selected and annotated support set from the target domain. This paper argues that randomly selecting the support set can be further improved for effecï¿¾tively adapting the pre-trained source models to the target
domain. Alternatively, we propose SelectNAdapt, an algoï¿¾rithm to curate the selection of the target domain samples, which are then annotated and included in the support set. In particular, for the K-shot adaptation problem, we first leverage self-supervision to learn features of the target doï¿¾main data. Then, we propose a per-class clustering scheme of the learned target domain features and select K repï¿¾resentative target samples using a distance-based scoring function. Finally, we bring our selection setup towards a practical ground by relying on pseudo-labels for clusterï¿¾ing semantically similar target domain samples. Our exï¿¾periments show promising results on three few-shot domain adaptation benchmarks for image recognition compared to related approaches and the standard random selection.

## Dependencies
The python environment of this project is the same as  [Dassl.Pytorch](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/Dassl.pytorch).

## Datasets
To download PACS dataset please visit this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ma3ple/pacs-dataset) , office-31 can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xixuhu/office31)

Datasets should be placed inside "./DATA/selectnadapt/imcls/data"

## Models
The source and self-supervised trained models can be downloaded from [here](https://faubox.rrze.uni-erlangen.de/getlink/fi2aftRT82WZcSrtw2CrTk/) and place them inside "output_source_models/" and "output_ss_models/" respectively.

## Run Code
To execute the selection process, you'll have to execute the following command, e.g.
```
python select_pacs.py --ouput_dir ""
```
